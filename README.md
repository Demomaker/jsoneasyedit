# JSON Easy Editor

This a JSON Editor for people who have no idea what they are doing interacting with JSON files.
Basically, the values are editable, but the keys are locked, so that no one screws up the generated file.
This is both an electron app and a web app in one repo.

## WEB Version
URL : https://demomaker.github.io/jsoneasyedit/

In the web app, it is only possible to open, edit and export a file.
(The save functionality cannot be reproduced in the web because of web restrictions)
